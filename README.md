# simple-text-generator
Simple text generator for OBS/Streamlabs. Used to show randomly a text on your overlay. This project can be improved.
> You can add a sentence in the Text Box then it will save it on a list.txt. Add your obs.txt file as a source in OBS/Streamlabs, then the generator will update it each 30 seconds.
